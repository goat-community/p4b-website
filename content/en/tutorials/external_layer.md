#### Description of the feature

GOAT allows you to integrate your own external layers. With a huge selection of geographic maps, you can customize your analysis. You can either choose from the preset layers or add your own by using "source url".

#### Possible use cases

* Adding layers with additional information, such as the broadband mobile communities 5G, from Geoportal as external layer.
* Adding individual basemaps for your analyses.
