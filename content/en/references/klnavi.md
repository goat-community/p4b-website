summary: With KLNavi, the city of Kaiserslautern has set itself the goal of developing an innovative routing application that responds to the special needs of people with mobility limitations. The project built on the experience gained from GOAT and used OpenTripPlanner as well as Digitransit UI as further technologies.

planning_cases:
  - An easy-to-use routing application for people with mobility limitations, based on open source software and data
  - Use of a variety of spatial and mobility data - cadastral data of the city, timetable data of the local transport network, specially prepared geodata

overview: The developed web application is responsive and uses open source software as well as open data. It is made possible by the integration of various geodata, mobility data, routing algorithms and WebGIS technologies. The main goal is to provide tailor-made routing solutions that meet the specific needs of users. In particular, people with mobility limitations should benefit from alternative route options that are specifically tailored to their needs.  For example, physically impaired people or people with strollers may specify that they prefer slightly longer walkways over stairs. Another focus of the application is the visualization of a large number of mobility offers (e.g. public transport stops, bike sharing), which are included in the route calculation. This results in a high degree of personalisation and accuracy of route planning.

**Methodology and implementation**

As in many of our other projects, based on data pipelines from GOAT, a lot of data was refined and used for route calculation. Our approach is characterized by high flexibility. It is aimed at long-term maintenance and can easily be transferred to other cities.
