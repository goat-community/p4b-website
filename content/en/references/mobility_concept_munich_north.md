overview: For the "Transport concept for the north of Munich - potential analysis", we are carrying out accessibility analyses for Sweco as a subcontractor. Due to its attractive location in the greater Munich area, the region in the north of Munich has particularly dynamic and positive growth rates in terms of population and jobs. The project area comprises four districts of the state capital Munich as well as the neighbouring municipalities of Karlsfeld, Oberschleißheim, Unterscheißheim and the city of Dachau.
