### Main characteristics

GOAT...

...is an interactive, flexible and useful accessibility instrument.

...focuses on active mobility (e.g. walking and cycling).

...allows you to model scenarios.

...can be set up anywhere in the world.

...is open source and built completely with open source software.

...is highly customizable and extendable.

### Why GOAT?

It is evident that active mobility plays a very important role in urban mobility. GOAT as an accessibility instrument aims to aid in raising awareness to properly plan for pedestrians and cyclists during urban infrastructural developments. GOAT comes with numerous desirable features that make it ideal for accessibility planning.

Modelling active mobility (walking & cycling) in transport models is challenging and does not normally deliver expected results. Urban planners and decision makers need elaborate support to properly plan and improve active mobility. This gap can be conveniently filled by accessibility models.

Various accessibility tools exist already, however, there are is still a lot of potential for improvements. Especially in the urban planning fields, it is perceived that common accessibility tools lacks several functionalities including:

* Few of them consider active mobility.
* They often allow no scenario building.
* They tend to be hard or costly to implement.
* Few of them are open source.
* Transferring the tool to another study area can be cost- and time-consuming.
* Accessibility tools can be black boxes.

As much as GOAT may not be perfect in functionality and operation at the moment, it has come in place to address these emerging issues and tackle them.

### Planning Questions

Although GOAT is at an early stage of development, it can be used to answer different planning questions. Some examples are:

* How good is the walking accessibility to kindergartens in different parts of the city?
* How good is the cycling accessibility to schools?
* How many residents are served by certain public transport stops? Where can the perfect location for a new public transport be in order to serve as many residents as possible?
* What is the effect of a new pedestrian or bicycle bridge on the accessibility of a neighborhood?
* How does the accessibility of a place change if there is temporary closure of a walkway?
* How many people can reach a certain destination within 10 minutes walking distance? How does this change if only barrier-free paths can be used? Where are barriers in the network and how could they be removed?
* How high is the diversity and availability of gastronomy in different neighborhoods?

Many more related questions in transport and land-use planning will follow. GOAT is mainly designed to be useful for planners, researchers, and decision makers, but due to its open nature it invites everybody to use it.

### Philosophy

GOAT's architecture is completely built with open source software, in addition, it is open source itself (Licence GPL-3.0). This means that GOAT can be modified and used by anyone (free of charge). Anyone can also contribute towards improving the functionality and operation of GOAT.

The OpenStreetMap-data (OSM) with which GOAT is built is available worldwide and free of charge. OSM is seen as an extremely valuable source but it also has to be highlighted, that it is not only targeted to consume the data but also actively be part of the OSM-community. This decision is considered essential for the health of this project and others. It also has to be mentioned that the setup of GOAT allows frequent data updates, which makes it easy for users to improve OSM as a data warehouse and benefit from rising data quality in the analyses.

Although GOAT is built with OSM-data (land-use, points of interests), other data sources can be conveniently added. Currently, we source from the Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy on boundaries and the Federal Statistical Office on census population data. 
Due to its modular nature, the GOAT application allows for easy extension and scalability. Since it is developed as a research project, state-of-the art and innovative approaches are widely used.

Everybody is welcome to use and contribute to GOAT. If you are interested in contributing just visit our [GitHub](https://github.com/goat-community/goat).
