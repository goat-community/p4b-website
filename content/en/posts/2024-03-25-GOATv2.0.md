As cities increasingly harness the power of data, the importance of data-driven solutions in urban development has become undeniable. Yet, while the significance of data is clear, translating it into actionable insights remains a challenge. Ensure user access to urban data is essential for advancing urban improvement and fostering fully sustainable cities. Bridging the gap between technology and practitioners is at the core of every Plan4Better project, and GOAT is no exception. With Version 2.0 on the horizon, we recognize the pivotal role of user feedback in developing a platform that truly meets the needs of its users. In this article, we delve into the process of how we engaged our users in the development of GOAT Version 2.0, refining its interface and features through workshops and interviews.

## Urban Data: Complexities & Necessities:

Dealing with urban data presents multifaceted challenges in the realm of urban planning. While data availability is no longer a significant concern, the complexity arises in selecting and effectively integrating the most pertinent data into the planning process. As urban planning encompasses a myriad of frameworks and methodologies, our priority in developing Version 2.0 was to ensure its adaptability to various project frameworks, thereby maximizing its utility across diverse planning contexts. Although Version 1 demonstrated competency in this regard, our interactions with users and practitioners underscored the need for enhanced flexibility in GOAT's functionality, allowing for broad applicability while maintaining robust data processing capabilities. 

A primary challenge in data-based planning lies in the diversity and often, incompatibility of available data sources. In Version 1, providing users with access to all available data necessitated the cumbersome task of reconciling disparate datasets for user utilization. This not only prolonged the data analysis process but also imposed limitations on the types of analyses that could be conducted. Therefore, a key objective for Version 2 was to streamline data usage within GOAT, facilitating seamless integration and expanding the tool's versatility for a broader range of applications. Leading to the addition of the GOAT Dashboard, allowing the user to upload and manage their own very data. Later, we uncover the user need of sharing and collaborating on projects. GOAT Version 2.0 Dashboard empowers planners by creating their team and sharing across GOAT data and projects.

## User Workshops: A Collaborative Approach to Urban Data Challenges: 

At the onset of Version 2 development, we recognized the need to address the complexities of urban and mobility planning through a user-centric approach. We sought to understand the diverse needs and challenges faced by urban planners and practitioners through active user feedback, indirect inquiries and a series of workshops involving both internal and external stakeholders and users. 

These workshops aimed to engage, empathize, and ideate with our users. Among the tools applied our team created user personas, representative profiles that encapsulated the characteristics and needs of different user groups. Through collaborative discussions and interactive exercises, we delved into various user scenarios, exploring their requirements, goals, and pain points in urban planning and mobility tasks.

We were able to summarize invaluable insights into user preferences and priorities. Always highlighting the importance of a user-friendly interface and catering to individuals with varying levels of technical proficiency. Clarity regarding data quality and security emerged as a top concern, highlighting the need for transparent data management practices within the platform. 

A core user concern dealt with delivering products produced within GOAT environment, as well as its styling capabilities. The flexibility to adapt maps, analysis, tables, and charts to their multiple purposes. Whether is a study, a project or an official document, the user wants to customize their analysis to make better use of the urban data towards their final goal.

Throughout the workshops, our team remained committed to active listening and collaboration, ensuring that user perspectives informed every stage of development. These iterative sessions not only validated some of our initial assumptions but also sparked innovative ideas and directions for the platform. By prioritizing user involvement and feedback, we aimed to create a tool that truly resonated with the needs and aspirations of urban planners and practitioners. As it is an ongoing process, we now are in the testing phase.
