GOAT is a cloud-based open source solution, which is operated via an interactive web map. The analyses in GOAT are based on innovative methods for fusing and refining open data. With these, we can now feed the GOAT versions for all desired cities and regions in Germany. We distribute the software as a SaaS solution, populated with data, to municipalities, counties and consultants. On request, GOAT can also be transferred to study areas worldwide. 

NEW: GOAT with user login, improved user interface and faster analyses 

We have followed the numerous user requests and implemented a user login with our new GOAT version 1.1, which allows to save created scenarios and to upload own data sets. 

In addition, the existing user interface of GOAT has been revised and improved. Calculations can now be performed easier and faster. Due to further improvements, analyses can now be performed even faster. 

Are you interested in GOAT and would like to try out the functionalities for yourself? Just click on the link below, fill out the contact form and you will receive your personal access to the demo version for Munich. The demo version is valid for 30 days.
