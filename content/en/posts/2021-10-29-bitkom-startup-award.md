## We are the winners! 

Great news – we are the winners of the [Smart Country Startup Award](https://www.bitkom.org/Themen/Startups/Smart-Country-Startup-Award) in the category "Smart City", which was awarded at the [Smart Country Convention](https://www.smartcountry.berlin/de/) in Berlin by [Get Started](https://www.bitkom.org/getstarted), the startup initiative of the digital association [Bitkom](https://www.bitkom.org/)! We are very happy about the award, the one-year Get Started membership and the prize money of 5,000 euros.

## The competition

We were invited to the final pitch in Berlin as one of three startups and were allowed to pitch against [Semir Babajić](https://www.linkedin.com/in/semirbabajic94/) from [Treesense](https://treesense.net/ "Treesense") and Justus Pohle from [HEIDI](https://heidi-app.de/ "HEImat DIgital"). 

In just three minutes pitch and two minutes of questions by an expert panel, we were able to convince the jury of our digital planning tool [GOAT](../../goat/). We highlighted the potential of GOAT to help in finding the ideal locations for new educational institutions, such as primary schools.

We are pleased that the planning of sustainable cities with our fact-based planning tool has met with such a good response - this shows us that we are on the right track with our tool and motivates us to continue full of enthusiasm.

## Thanks for the nice event
