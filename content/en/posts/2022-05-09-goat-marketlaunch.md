## Market launch of GOAT

[GOAT](/en/goat "What is GOAT?") is a cloud-based planning instrument, which supports planners in implementing the 15-min-city by combining the land use and transport component. GOAT is fully open source and operates via an interactive web map. The analyses in GOAT are based on a large number of spatial data, which are aggregated using innovative fusion and refinement methods. With these, we can now set up the GOAT versions for all desired cities and regions in Germany. 

We are happy to now offer our software as a SaaS solution to municipalities, counties and consultants. On request, GOAT can also be transferred to study areas worldwide.

## NEW: GOAT with user login, improved user interface and faster analyses

We have gladly followed the numerous user requests and implemented a user login with our new GOAT version 1.1, which allows to save created scenarios and to upload own data sets. In addition, the existing user interface of GOAT has been improved and calculations can now be performed more easily and quickly. 

Are you interested in GOAT and would like to try out the functionalities for yourself? Just click on the [link](/en/request-demo/ "Request GOAT demo"), fill out the contact form and you will receive your personal access to the demo version for Munich. The demo version is valid for 30 days.
