The event was held virtually and was broadcast on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrtAhTyqvEs "Sommerrunde 2021: Preisverleihung") and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/events/sommerrunde2021-preisverleihung6863773724685008896/ "Sommerrunde 2021: Preisverleihung"). However, the co-hosts Ms. Alexa von Busse and Dr. Alexander Tettenborn, head of division within the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy, transported the pleasant atmosphere right through the screen.

[Thomas Jarzombek](https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/EN/Artikel/Curriculum-Vitae/curriculum-vitae-jarzombek.html "Thomas Jarzombek"), Commissioner for the Digital Industry and startups of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) gave a keynote speech that was informative and encouraging. He emphasized the potential of the startup award, which not only serves as a financial booster but is also a great way to network with the business community!

## Elevator Pitch: Presentation in one minute

The winning teams were able to present themselves and their innovations with one-minute-pitches. Ulrike Jehle explained the functionality, the development process, and the added value of our digital reachability tool [GOAT](https://plan4better.de/en/goat/ "GOAT") for Plan4Better.

The jury emphasized the significant added value of GOAT in urban planning, especially in the design of footpaths and cycle paths and neighborhood planning of public utilities. Other outstanding criteria were the technical competence of the founders and the high technical standards of Plan4Better.

To put it in words, which Dr. Tettenborn from the Ministry used in his moderation: "Sustainability at its best" - that's what we are aiming for!

Further innovations from different areas such as industry, medicine, tourism, working conditions, etc. were selected in the categories “Startup Award”, “Startup Award +” and a special award "Digital Cities and Regions". For the latter, Dr. Christine Kahlen, sub-department heads for national and European digital agenda held the laudation.
